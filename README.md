# Task Overview
You are working on an HR backend API built with FastAPI that provides employee data. The application includes a custom middleware responsible for logging requests and responses for audit compliance. Recently, after deployment, all API endpoints began returning 500 Internal Server Error responses, though business logic remains untouched. Investigation points to a serialization error related to the audit middleware. Your task is to resolve the error specifically within the middleware so that all endpoints work correctly and detailed audit logging continues.

# Guidance
- The middleware should log relevant information for compliance without disrupting FastAPI's core response mechanics.
- No changes to the existing endpoint logic or data models are required.
- Stick to only FastAPI and Python standard libraries; do not add other dependencies.
- Maintain all best practices for reliability and compliance throughout your changes.

# Objectives
- Fix the custom middleware so all API endpoints return their expected JSON data without error.
- Ensure audit logging remains robust and compliant, capturing appropriate request and response details.
- The core application logic, especially endpoints like `/employees`, should return correct data as intended by FastAPI.

# How to Verify
- Run the application and access the `/employees` endpoint; it should return a valid JSON response without a 500 error.
- Check application log output to confirm that request details are being successfully logged for each API call without serialization errors.
- Ensure all expected API endpoints function as intended with audit-compliant logging present.
